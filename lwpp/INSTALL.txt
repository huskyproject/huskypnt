| Installing Lwpp |
+-----------------+

Installing lwpp should be relatively straightforward:

  (0) Inspect the Makefile to ensure that things will work for your
      system.  In particular, pay attention to the following settings:
      
        PREFIX
        INSTALL_BIN
        MKDIRS
        CC
        OPTFLAGS
        WARNFLAGS

  (1) Build the lwpp program:
  
        make

  (2) Test lwpp on the included sample files:
  
        ./lwpp ./tmp.txt
        ./lwpp ./tmp2.txt

      The first file should generate text on standard output.  The
      second should generate some text on standard output and a warning
      on standard error.

  (3) Install lwpp:
  
        make install

  (4) There you are.

If you have RPM <http://www.rpm.org/> installed on your system, you can
build source and binary RPM packages directly from the lwpp tarball
using the included spec file:

        rpm -ta --clean lwpp-<version>.tar.gz

where <version> is the version of lwpp.

See the `README' file for more information about lwpp.
