currently:
- save config between sessions (useful if compiling fails)

near future:
- use nmcopy
- multi-user support
- scroll texts in showFile
- check entered data
- BinkD support
- put maint etc. into crontab
- update english part
- CDP support
- use new version of carc (yet to be written)
- write intro screen on how to use HuskyPnt (GNU readline etc.)
- use less fixed-size buffers (like cwd[1024])
- translate config remarks to english

later:
- shortname support
- support for other platforms (especially OS/2 and Win32)
- outbound-viewer for HuskyUI
- translation to other languages (volunteers needed, I only speak german and
  english)
- AreaFix interface
- FLS (File List Server / Search) interface
- Update mode
- Uninstall

I'm not angry if you send patches for bugfixes or new features. :)
