near future:
- remove OS dependencies
- menu-based configuration with GNU readline
- BinkD support
- nltools
- check entered data
- CDP support
- translate config remarks to english

later:
- translation to other languages (volunteers needed, I only speak german and
  english)
- support for other platforms (especially OS/2 and Win32)
- outbound-viewer for HuskyUI

I'm not angry if you send patches for bugfixes or new features. :)
