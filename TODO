near future:
- menu-based configuration with GNU readline
- nltools
- conditionals in templates (e.g. for ifcico + ISDN vs. modem)
- check entered data
- CDP support

later:
- translation to other languages (volunteers needed, I only speak german and
  english)
- support for other platforms (especially OS/2 and Win32)
- outbound-viewer for HuskyUI

I'm not angry if you send patches for bugfixes or new features. :)
