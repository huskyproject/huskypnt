currently:
- use GNU readline if available
- adapt configs to latest fidoconf etc. versions

near future:
- scroll texts in showFile
- save config between sessions (useful if compiling fails)
- check entered data
- BinkD support
- nltools
- CDP support
- use less static buffers (like cwd[1024])
- translate config remarks to english

later:
- support for other platforms (especially OS/2 and Win32)
- outbound-viewer for HuskyUI
- translation to other languages (volunteers needed, I only speak german and
  english)
- AreaFix interface
- FLS interface
- Uninstall

I'm not angry if you send patches for bugfixes or new features. :)
