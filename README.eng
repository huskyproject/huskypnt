				HuskyPnt
				========

HuskyPnt is a point packet that bases on software of the husky project.
A primary goal is to support as many (natural) languages and platforms as
possible. However, currently only the german and english version for Linux
are usable.

ATTENTION: This is a ALPHA-version! I do not guarantee anything!
	   Because the installation routine runs as root it may
	   nonreversibly damage your system!
